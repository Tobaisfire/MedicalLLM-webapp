Introduce yourself and direct patient to take a seat. In the hospital, bring your chair to bedside; do not sit on the bed. Unkempt and disheveled in cognitive disorder; pinpoint pupils in narcotic addiction; withdrawal and stooped posture in depression. Motoric behavior: Level of activity: Psychomotor agitation or psychomotor retardation—tics, tremors, automatisms, mannerisms, grimacing, stereotypes, negativism, apraxia, echopraxia, waxy flexibility; emotional appearance— anxious, tense, panicky, bewildered, sad, unhappy: voice—faint, loud, hoarse; eye contact Have you been more active than usual? Less active? You may ask about obvious mannerisms, e.g., “I notice that your hand still shakes, can you tell me about that?” Stay aware of smells, e.g., alcoholism/ketoacidosis.

Psychomotor retardation in depression; tremors with anxiety or medication side effect (lithium). Eye contact is normally made approximately half the time during the interview.

Panic-inducing substances include carbon dioxide, sodium lactate, methyl-chlorophenyl-piperazine (mCPP), carbolines, GABAB receptor antagonists, caffeine, isoproterenol, and yohimbine (Yocon). VIII. Differential Diagnosis A. Depressive disorders. Fifty percent to 70% of depressed patients exhibit anxiety or obsessive brooding; 20% to 30% of primarily anxious patients also experience depression. B. Schizophrenia. Schizophrenic patients may be anxious and have severe obsessions in addition to or preceding the outbreak of hallucinations or delusions. C. Bipolar I disorder. Massive anxiety may occur during a manic episode. D. Atypical psychosis (psychotic disorder not otherwise specified). Massive anxiety is present, in addition to psychotic features. E. Adjustment disorder with anxiety. Patient has a history of a psychosocial stressor within 3 months of onset. F. Medical and neurologic conditions. A secondary anxiety disorder is caused by a specific medical or biologic factor. Undiagnosed hyperthryroidism is a frequent cause. Other causes are listed in Table 12-18. G. Substance-related disorders. Panic or anxiety is often associated with intoxication (especially caffeine, cocaine, amphetamines, hallucinogens) and withdrawal states (see Table 12-13). H. Cognitive disorder. Severe anxiety may interfere with cognition and impairments may occur; however, they remit when the anxiety is diminished, unlike the cognitive defects in dementia. IX. Course and Prognosis A. Separation anxiety disorder 1. Starts as early as 1 year of age. 2. Periods of exacerbations and remissions. 3. Adults may have social and occupational dysfunction. 4.

      "Based on the comprehensive clinical information provided for Patient ID 25/7891, the deep diagnostic impression is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Primary Diagnosis:**\n",
      "- **Bipolar I Disorder, current episode (Mixed) or possibly a Mixed Episode of Bipolar Disorder**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Supporting findings for this diagnosis include:**\n",
      "- **History of Bipolar Disorder:** Known psychiatric diagnosis with longstanding symptoms (20 years duration).\n",
      "- **Current Clinical Presentation:**\n",
      "  - Elevated psychomotor activity, increased talkativeness (\"Big talks\"), inflated self-esteem.\n",
      "  - Decreased need for sleep.\n",
      "  - Pressured but possibly slowed speech.\n",
      "  - Mood appears to fluctuate between depression and agitation.\n",
      "- **Behavioral Observations during consultation:**\n",
      "  - Disorganized, tangential thought process.\n",
      "  - Distrustful, suspicious over family members.\n",
      "  - Aggressive, abusive behavior, and violent tendencies.\n",
      "  - Inflated self-esteem suggests grandiosity.\n",
      "  - Grandiosity aligns with manic/mixed features.\n",
      "- **Additional Features:**\n",
      "  - Agitation and irritability.\n",
      "  - Increased alcohol use, which could be an attempt at self-medication or part of mood instability.\n",
      "  - Partial insight and judgment impairment, typical in manic/mixed episodes.\n",
      "- **Medical and family background:**\n",
      "  - Existing bipolar diagnosis.\n",
      "  - Family history of anxiety disorder (mother), which can be a comorbid factor.\n",
      "  - Current medications suggest maintenance for bipolar disorder, but the presence of agitation and violent behavior indicates possible episode recurrence or medication non-compliance/effectiveness.\n",
      "- **Mental Status Examination (MSE):**\n",
      "  - Appearance: Disheveled and agitated.\n",
      "  - Mood: Depressed and anxious but also exhibiting features of agitation and inflated self-esteem, consistent with a mixed mood state.\n",
      "  - Thought process: Disorganized and tangential, supporting a manic/mixed episode.\n",
      "  - Insight and judgment: Partial, indicating impaired awareness of illness severity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional considerations:**\n",
      "- The aggressive and paranoid behaviors, suspiciousness, and abusive tendencies could indicate a comorbid psychotic component, which aligns with bipolar disorder with psychotic features during episodes.\n",
      "- The recent increase in alcohol consumption and agitation suggests a possible substance-induced exacerbation of symptoms.\n",
      "- The presentation resembles a **mixed episode** of bipolar disorder, where features of mania (elevated self-esteem, decreased sleep, agitation) are concurrent with depressive symptoms (depressed mood, anxious affect).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential considerations:**\n",
      "- Given her history, other diagnoses like schizoaffective disorder or borderline personality disorder should be considered, especially considering her disorganized thought process, impulsivity, aggression, and transient insight. However, the core features align more closely with bipolar disorder with mixed features.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important note:**\n",
      "- Caution should be exercised given her medication profile and alcohol use, which might influence symptom presentation and severity.\n",
      "- Immediate safety measures and stabilization should be prioritized, potentially with revision of her medication regimen and addressing substance use.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The patient is experiencing a **mixed episode of Bipolar I disorder**, characterized by simultaneous manic and depressive symptoms, with prominent agitation, disorganized thought process, agitation, suspiciousness, and behavioral disturbances. She requires close psychiatric management, possibly inpatient stabilization, and an assessment to review and optimize her medication regimen, alongside interventions for alcohol use and aggression management.\n"

Panic-inducing substances include carbon dioxide, sodium lactate, methyl-chlorophenyl-piperazine (mCPP), carbolines, GABAB receptor antagonists, caffeine, isoproterenol, and yohimbine (Yocon). VIII. Differential Diagnosis A. Depressive disorders. Fifty percent to 70% of depressed patients exhibit anxiety or obsessive brooding; 20% to 30% of primarily anxious patients also experience depression. B. Schizophrenia. Schizophrenic patients may be anxious and have severe obsessions in addition to or preceding the outbreak of hallucinations or delusions. C. Bipolar I disorder. Massive anxiety may occur during a manic episode. D. Atypical psychosis (psychotic disorder not otherwise specified). Massive anxiety is present, in addition to psychotic features. E. Adjustment disorder with anxiety. Patient has a history of a psychosocial stressor within 3 months of onset. F. Medical and neurologic conditions. A secondary anxiety disorder is caused by a specific medical or biologic factor. Undiagnosed hyperthryroidism is a frequent cause. Other causes are listed in Table 12-18. G. Substance-related disorders. Panic or anxiety is often associated with intoxication (especially caffeine, cocaine, amphetamines, hallucinogens) and withdrawal states (see Table 12-13). H. Cognitive disorder. Severe anxiety may interfere with cognition and impairments may occur; however, they remit when the anxiety is diminished, unlike the cognitive defects in dementia. IX. Course and Prognosis A. Separation anxiety disorder 1. Starts as early as 1 year of age. 2. Periods of exacerbations and remissions. 3. Adults may have social and occupational dysfunction. 4.
